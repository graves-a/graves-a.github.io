  About Me
</h1>
Hello, I’m Alan Graves.
I started my journey to become a Software Engineer at the end of 2018. For most of my career, I’ve been an electronics technician/engineering technician where I built, tested, and troubleshooted electronic devices in aviation, oil and gas, and most recently, consumer electronics. It wasn’t until I joined the Engineering department and saw the products being developed that inspired me to go to school to become a Software Engineer. Throughout the computer science program at SNHU, I mainly used Java and Python with a little C/C++ here and there. After starting my internship with the high-level team at Garmin, I really grew to love C++. I am now in my final term for my Bachelor’s of Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.

## Java
I am confident in my skills with Java as that is the programming language I’ve spent the most time with throughout the computer science program. I’ve made several programs in the various courses as well as some outside of school. This was the language of choice when doing coding problems on CodeForces to work on my problem-solving skills. I also have some experience with android development where I made a tile game

## Python
Python is the second language I have the most experience with as many classes I took at SNHU used Python. I’ve written several programs both for school and outside of school as well as a program I used while I was an engineering technician to help with radiated emissions testing during data transfer to and from the device under test.

## C++
I don’t have as much experience with C++ as I do with Java and Python, but it is becoming my language of choice here recently. I only had a few classes that were in C++ such as the data structures and algorithms class and OpenGL, but I really started enjoying it during my internship. I have around three months of experience, not including schoolwork, developing in C++ where I worked on elements of the GUI for consumer products as well as speech recognition.

  Project 1: Zoo Authentication

</div>

```markdown
Zoo Authentication is an app written in C++ that utilizes sqlite3. It stores usernames and encrypted passwords using SHA2 in the database. When the user logs in, they are able to see their "role" at the zoo as well as update their role, their username, and their password. This app was originally written in Java and the user information and roles were stored in plain text files with no encryption or input validation. I wanted to convert it to C++ to get more experience with that language.

  Project 2: Data structures and algorithms time complexity

  <a href="https://github.com/graves-a/DataStructures">GitHub</a>
</div>

```markdown
Data Structures is an app written in C++ that allows you to see the time complexity of the different data structures and alogirthms. It is included with a csv file that has around 18,000 entries from a fake auction with details such as bidID, the name of the item, the fund, and the winning bid amount. You are able to load the csv file into a vector, linked list, hash table, and binary search tree. Each time the csv file is loaded, it will tell you how long it took to load all entries as well as the total entries loaded. From here you can do things such as search for an entry, order the entries, delete and entry, and display all entries to the console.

  Project 3: Database creator

</div>

```markdown
Database Creator is an app written in C++ that utilizes sqlite3. When the app is first launched, you are given two choices to either create a new database or access an existing one. If you choose to create a new one, it will then prompt you where to save the database. If you choose to access an existing database, you will enter the location of the database and then be greated with the tools needed to maintain it. You can create new tables, get a list of existing tables, insert data into any table, update data, remove entries, and delete the entire table.
